summary: A sharp contrarian wedge on Vercel's agent-directory format landed at 163 against a 597 cohort median — the room was one vendor's spec, and no firsthand artifact was offered to widen it.
wiki_candidate: A contrarian wedge does not raise a t0 subject's ceiling; wedge quality and room size are independent.

The post took Vercel's newly opened agent format and argued the real bet is structural — that an agent is a directory rather than code — positioning against the prevailing framing.

It landed at 163 impressions against a 597 median for its 1-to-4-week scrape cohort, 27% of cohort, and is one of the two lowest news posts outside the Windows Paint miss. It is already an exemplar of the t0 band in `wiki/audience.md` at exactly this number.

The wedge was good and the hook-to-body match was clean — the first line states the bet, the body explains what the directory actually contains. What was missing is the only flag the corpus validates: news posts without firsthand signal median 443 against 664 for posts that have it (0.67x). Nothing in the post came from the owner running the format. The second failure is structural rather than craft: one vendor's file-format decision is a t0 subject, and a contrarian frame does not enlarge the crowd that already cares. Vercel Zero, at 2192, is the counterexample that proves the boundary — a *new systems language* is a t1 sub-community subject, a *directory convention* is not.

The concrete change: block vendor-format-announcement as a standalone news subject. It clears the specificity bar and fails the room-size bar every time. Revisit only with a firsthand artifact — the owner's own agent ported into the format, with a number attached to what the port cost or saved.
